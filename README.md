<h1> This website was made by Madeleine Song for ENGL 1131: Crime and Criminality, and should ideally be viewed on a computer at 100% zoom.</h1>

The assignment was to find a document from the 17th, 18th, or 19th century written by or about someone who lived in the Atlantic world, and then compose an historically-informed, fictional account of the events it describes with a different perspective from the one the document offers. I chose the Annual report of the inspectors of the Eastern State Penitentiary of Pennsylvania (1848), and the alternate account I am offering is that of an anonymous prisoner.
