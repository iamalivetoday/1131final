<h1> ENGL 1131: Crime and Criminality </h1>

The assignment was to find a document from the 17th, 18th, or 19th century written by or about someone who lived in the Atlantic world, and then compose an historically-informed, fictional account of the events it describes with a different perspective from the one the document offers. 

I chose the Annual report of the inspectors of the Eastern State Penitentiary of Pennsylvania (1848), and the alternate account I am offering is that of an anonymous prisoner.

In the 1848 annual report of the inspectors of the Eastern State Penitentiary of
Pennsylvania, very little information is given about the people who actually lived there in
solitary confinement. Not a single prisoner's name is recorded. There is one farmer, but he is
referred to in the plural - one of a category of "farmers", "weavers" "merchants" "laborers" - and
written about in the passive tense. "The existence of insanity" and "death" are noted but not
ascribed to anyone in particular (as if insanity and death could exist independent of human form
or feeling?).
