<h1> ENGL 1131: Crime and Criminality </h1>

The assignment was to find a document from the 17th, 18th, or 19th century written by or about someone who lived in the Atlantic world, and then compose an historically-informed, fictional account of the events it describes with a different perspective from the one the document offers. 

I chose the Annual report of the inspectors of the Eastern State Penitentiary of Pennsylvania (1848), and the alternate account I am offering is that of an anonymous prisoner.

In the 1848 annual report of the inspectors of the Eastern State Penitentiary of
Pennsylvania, very little information is given about the people who actually lived there in
solitary confinement. Not a single prisoner's name is recorded. There is one farmer, but he is
referred to in the plural - one of a category of "farmers", "weavers" "merchants" "laborers" - and
written about in the passive tense. "The existence of insanity" and "death" are noted but not
ascribed to anyone in particular (as if insanity and death could exist independent of human form
or feeling?).

I wanted to better understand the people who had lived in Eastern State, but spending an
afternoon at the Penitentiary revealed less than I'd hoped: I learned a lot about the architects, and
the architecture, but the prisoners were walked to their cells with hoods above their heads and
prohibited from leaving their rooms - what knowledge would they have had of the radial floor
plan? I did get to visit Al Capone's cell, which was furnished with rugs, paintings, nice furniture,
and a radio - "he liked to listen to waltzes in his cell", said my guide. But none of these were
affordances allowed to other prisoners in solitary confinement - they were affordances made
specifically for Al Capone. Other prisoners were scarcely aloud to listen to anything at all! They
were instructed not to speak unless spoken to, and not to make any unnecessary noise. The
guards patrolling the hallways wore socks over their boots to muffle their footsteps. Even the
wheels of the meal cart were soundless with wool coverings.

The rooms, both furnished and unfurnished, were austere: 1 bed, 4 walls, 1 pair of shoes,
and a ceiling. Not so the text of the report itself, which rolls on and on with metaphor and
allusions to God, literal walls and walls of text. But there's a strong religious presence in the
prison cells, too, with the high ceiling being the only source of light. I was reminded of how
carefully light is controlled in churches, to have height, to have shadow, to have the effect of
light in darkness, and indeed the small ocular window was referred to as the Eye of God.

It's impossible to know the interiority of one person and it is impossible to recover the
experience of the imprisoned. It would be wrong even to infer. Foucault mentions the "indignity
of speaking for others" as an example of an insidious way that intellectuals maintain equality by
purporting to "give voice to" the marginalized, and Gayatri Spivak further traces the desire to
speak for the other to the attempt to preserve oneself as a subject, such that 'any discourse is
eventually about the discoursing agents themselves.' I decided to attempt to re-narrate the annual
inspectors report from the perspective of a prisoner by focusing on what I did know - the view
from that one window. I found and took photos of the sky at every hour of the day, and I
juxtaposed that with the videos I'd taken of one cell and the exercise room, and then I used those
to create a web application which displayed a carousel of those photos to represent what
someone living in that cell might have seen. All the while, a counter, which begins the moment a
user enters the website, displays the number of seconds, minutes, hours, and days that the
window has been open. When the mouse moves over one of the photos on the carousel, a quote
from the annual report fades in, and then fades out
